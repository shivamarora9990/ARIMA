# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA Model
I developed a time series forecasting model using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) technique. The project involved pre-processing and analyzing historical financial data, identifying seasonality, trends, and noise. The ARIMA model was implemented to predict future stock prices based on historical trends. I performed data wrangling, visualizations, and model optimization to improve prediction accuracy. The project highlights my proficiency in statistical modeling, Python, and libraries such as pandas, statsmodels, and matplotlib. This approach is particularly useful for forecasting in finance and other domains where data exhibits temporal patterns.
